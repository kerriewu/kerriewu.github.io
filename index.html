                                    I am a junior studing mechanical engineering with a concentration in computer science at MIT. I'm interested in robotics, mechanical design, assistive technology, and controls. 
                                    In my free time, I enjoy practicing classical guitar, spinning flow props (sometimes on fire), and amateur carpentry.

                    <h4 class="modal-title">Remote-controlled robot</h4>
                    <p>I designed and fabricated an RC robot that lifts two lanterns and hangs them on a hook about three feet above ground level as part of 2.007, MIT's introduction to design and manufacturing class (often known as the root of FIRST robotics). This robot won the Whitelaw Prize for Originality in Design and qualified for the final tournament with the top 32 scoring robots in a class of 150 students. </p>
                    <p>                        
                    The task breaks up into two parts: (1) lifting the lanterns and (2) rotating the lanterns such that both of them can hang from the hook at once. To make operation easy and keep everything as simple as possible, I tried to do complete both of these tasks with only one motor. Here's a video of operation (watch all the way until the end to see the rotation!)</p>
                    <iframe class=g3 height=500 src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kexPTYyXEx0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

                        <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Some of the constraints that I worked with included a maximum robot size of 16"x16"x16", a time limit of 1.5 minutes, and a specific set of servos/motors for actuation. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I started off the design process by brainstorming methods of lifting. Feasible options I considered included a scissorlift, multi-stage arms, and a linear lift. Prior class knowledge informed me that scissorlifts were particularly difficult to make stable and actuate effectively, and multi-stage arms seemed like they would involve too many orientation changes, I decided to go with a linear lift. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Some preliminary lift designs are below. Since I was having trouble weighing the benefits of more material/stability vs. minimizing machining time and weight, I CADed them out as a quick way of visualizing them with reasonable dimensions. The final lift design I decided to go with is on the right, after getting a feel for the stiffness and weight of the aluminum sheets.
                    </p>

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I made sure to reduce friction as much as possible by having no aluminum-aluminum rubbing interfaces, using bushings for the pulleys and interfaces between each lift stage. This also turned out to be a good way of constraining the lifts horizontally relative to each other, since each bushing has a small lip.
                    </p>
                    <img src="../images/bushingcloseup.png" alt="" class = g3>
                    <p>
                        To rotate the two lanterns without requiring more actuation, I attached the ends of the pulley strings to arms that would rotate the lanterns in the appropriate radii (which I found by measuring the distances between the bottom outer corners of the lanterns in the desired start and end positions, and doing some sketches in Solidworks).

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        For the winch, I used a VS-11 servo motor (the highest power motor we had available to us), and delrin spools that I turned. I did a quick torque calculation to figure out the approximate highest efficiency radius.  If I had time, I would probably go back and constrain the winch better, though--it was a little wobbly and probably could have gone faster.

                        Fabrication-wise, almost all the pieces of my completed robot were made of waterjetted and folded sheet aluminum, or aluminum rods. I controlled it using a PS2 controller and an Arduino Nano. Some photos of the final robot are below.

<!--
                    <p>I designed a “smart pill bottle” kit that modifies a standard pharmacy pill bottle as part of my work at Little Devices. The modified bottle tracks usage data whenever the bottle is opened and closed, and uses has an alarm to remind the user to take a dose at specified times. This kit is intended for use by caregivers and patients who require medication, and for use in educational/outreach contexts.</p>
                    
                    <p> The electronics used were TinyCircuits, which are modular Arduino-compatible microcontrollers/accesories. There was already an existing code base for data logging, which I modified to add the alarm and usage sensing capabilities. To give it a completed look, I designed a 3D-printed cap to cover the circuits. Here are some photos of the finished bottle.

                    <p>For freshman welcome week in August 2015, I co-led construction of a 28-foot trebuchet/inverted swing ride with my friend Mikael Kalin.  We began designing and CADing in March of that year, improving off of a previously built version. We built the entire structure in one week with the newly arrived pre-frosh, also providing hands-on instruction on power tool use and safety, and operated it for a week following. </p>

                    <p>This ride was last built in 2006 by previous MIT students for freshman orientation week. We looked at photo documentation from the previous ride and replicated the design as a starting point, and then revised to improve its safety/stability. Most notably, we used a larger pipe for the axis of the arm and redesigned the connection from the pipe to the base. We also used bearings, reducing the friction when swinging, and changed the way we loaded counterweights at the bottom of the arm such that it was adjustable in 50-lb increments. </p>
